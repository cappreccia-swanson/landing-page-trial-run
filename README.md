# Landing Page Project

*****************************************************

## My Information
This project was done in part by watching hours of YouTube videos to gain a better understanding, reading MDN Docs, asking for help in the Slack community (which further confused me), and then back to YouTube. I learned so much and have come quite far in my coding journey. This is my best attempt at exhibiting my proficiency thus far.

This journey will continue on my GitHub ad I continue to strengthen my frontend web development skills.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
